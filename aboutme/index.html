    <h2>Larios Avana</h2>
    <p>I'm currently working toward a Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology with a focus on Web Design and Development (WDD). I'm really passionate about technology and love learning how to use it to solve real-world problems.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, exploring new ideas, spending time with my family, and working on small tech projects. I’m married and blessed with wonderful children who keep life interesting and full of joy.</p>
    <p>I currently serve in a leadership role at the temple, which I love, and I'm using this opportunity at BYU-Idaho to grow professionally and personally. I’m not switching careers but deepening my skills so I can do more in the tech field.</p>
    <p>One thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is the spiritual foundation it brings to learning. I appreciate how the gospel is integrated into everything we study, and how it helps me see my education with an eternal perspective. I’m pursuing a BS degree and excited to strengthen my abilities in web design.</p>
    <p>I see a lot of advantages in learning web design—it opens up opportunities to create, build, and even help others by developing solutions that are accessible and impactful. I'm taking this course to gain practical skills I can use in future professional roles or to support Church service and personal projects.</p>
    <p>I’ve been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for many years. One of my favorite scriptures is Mosiah 2:17: <strong><em>“When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.”</em></strong> I also love President Nelson’s teachings on the power of spiritual momentum.</p>
    <p>I’m really looking forward to learning with all of you this semester and building meaningful connections!</p>
